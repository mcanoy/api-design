## Automation API
The current swagger.yaml file defines the automation API used throughout Open Innovation Labs. Over time it is likely that we'll model multiple APIs in this repository, and move Automation to a sub directory.


## Code Generation
The code-gen folder contains scripts and helpers to generate the code we need from these APIs. For now, the scripts need to be run in the code-gen directory else they will fail.
